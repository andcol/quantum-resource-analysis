# quantum-resource-analysis
Exploration of type-level resource analysis of quantum programs in Idris.

[Here](https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/starting.html) you can find instructions on how to install Idris 1.3.3. To compile an example program, run

    $ idris withancillae.idr -o withancillae

To execute the resulting binary (which is uninteresting in these case since this work focuses on compile-time), just use `./withancillae`.
